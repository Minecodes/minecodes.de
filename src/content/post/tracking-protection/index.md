## Google Tracking

Maybe you've seen it in some other articles but it's here now. Chrome gets "Tracking Protection"[^1].
Now, you may be asking, “wait… doesn’t Google earn most of they’re money through
tracking and advertisement?” The answer is, yes! Instead, they introduced an
alternative to the standard tracking cookies, and now they tracking you with
your search history (even without using Google as the search engine), can track
the opened links through “Safe Search” (the links get send to Google servers),
can still track you with their “Ad topics”, “Site-suggested ads”, “Ad
measurement” features, their two search histories on your Google account, your
location history, and your personalized advertisement over your Google account,
when you don’t turn it off.

## My experiment

For example, I had a fresh created Google account,
with fake data, in Google Chrome and searched for Minecraft cheating content on
YouTube. Then after I watched some of these videos, Google already knew which
languages I spoke (system was in English), and which type of gamer I was. Other
topics might be inaccurate, but for 30 minutes of searching and watching
content, it was a very accurate result.

## Bad alternatives

Even if I used an alternative to Chrome,
like Opera, Chromium, or Yandex Browser, they still send enough data to Google
or even other companies, who are located in critical regimes, that they can
track me accurately. For Opera, it would be China, and for Yandex, it would be
Russia. The best alternatives to this problem would be to use other browsers.

## Good alternatives & tips

Good alternatives are Brave, Firefox, or Vivaldi. If you want to have even
better privacy, LibreWolf, Tor Browser, and Mulvad Browser would be your best
choices. If you already done that and want to upgrade your privacy, then I can
also recommend [“Privacy Handbuch”](https://www.privacy-handbuch.de) by Karsten Neß,

only recommend.
